# Redoran-Extended---Survival Addon

![Image 0](X)

# Introduction

Hello! This addon will integrate various mods designed to expand survival themed gameplay into the world of Redoran-ified Skyrim. This will be a **manual process** with various steps involving downloading, rearranging, etc. A provided megapatch will be available at the end of the guide.

A **NEW SAVE is required**.

# Installation

First of all, we're going to right-click on the left side of MO2 and highlight the "All Mods" option, then click the dropdown of "Create separator above". We'll call it **[NoDelete] [04.000] REDORAN EXTENDED - SURVIVAL**. All of the following mods will be installed under this separator, and the separator itself will go just below the separator called "THE DANGER ZONE". 

All the plugins going forward will be at the very bottom, **BELOW all of the Redoran patches** but **BEFORE DynDOLOD.esp**.

Screenshots are available at the bottom of this page to compare as you go.

   - **Currently works with [Redoran-Extended - NPC Overhaul Addon](https://github.com/Foamimi/Redoran-Extended---NPC-Overhaul/blob/main/README.md).**
   - **Currently needs a patch for [Redoran-Extended - NPC Dialogue Addon](https://github.com/Foamimi/Redoran-Extended---NPC-Dialogue/blob/main/README.md). You can find a patch here: [ [DOWNLOAD](X) ] ("View raw" button). 

# Changelog 

**IMPORTANT** - If updating Redoran (like from v.1.0.1 to 1.0.2 for example) your load order may become a bit funky on the right side of MO2. Luckily we numbered everything while installing, so the left side of MO2 should still be in tact, but to get everything back in position for the right side, I'd suggest disabling the entire Survival addon, then re-enabling everything again one by one. This takes a hot second, but I find this method to be the fastest (for me anyway!).
